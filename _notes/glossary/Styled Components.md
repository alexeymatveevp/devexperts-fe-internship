[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) is a CSS-in-JS solution for [[React]]

It allows to write CSS directly in react application

This approach has a number of benefits:
- the class names would be unique for each component
- encapsulated styles make it easier to refactor CSS
- full javascript support, you can create complex styling calculations if you want
- flexibility - when overriding components you can change their base style
