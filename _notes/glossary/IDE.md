# IDE
Integrated development environment - main software of a programmer

Yes you can write code in notepad, but it will get hard very quickly. IDE's are making coding easier by creating links between files (source code), making smart navigation, code writing and refactoring.

Most popular IDE's nowadays are:
* IntelliJ IDEA - ultimate version, which is even splitted into parts:
	* Web Storm - for FE development
	* Android Studio
	* PyCharm
	* ... (about 10 major IDE's are provided by JetBrains)
* Visual Studio Code - very popular for FE dev
* Sublime Text
* Eclipse
* NetBeans
