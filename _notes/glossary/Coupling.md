Coupling is a property in software development related to architectural components relationship between each other.

There are 2 types of coupling:
- **tight**
- **loose**

**Tight coupling** is when your components are tangled together as a ball of thread ðŸ§¶and you cannot easily un-tangle them, for example while analysing a code problem or when you need to extract 1 specific module our of the code - you will have hard times

**Loose coupling** is great! It's when you have a good architecture and components are assiciated with pre-defined rules and interfaces
