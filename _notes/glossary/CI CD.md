aliases: CI/CD, continuous integration, continuous delivery

CI/CD stands for continuous integration / continuous delivery. It's a composition of idea and software which implements it.

The idea is: software that we develop should be delivered to end user as fast as possible to reduce the TTM (time to market). In other words - "keep the ball rolling"

The integration part is usually about making changes in code visible to other systems / people as fast as possible.

> For example: if your manager can already demo the feature you pushed to Git 10 minutes ago to the potential client - it's properly configured CI/CD

Popular CI/CD tools:
* TeamCity
* Jenkins
* CircleCI
* Buddy
* Travis
* Stash CI

Here at Devexperts we use TeamCity (and we call it dxcity)
