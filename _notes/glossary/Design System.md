aliases: design system

Design system is a composition of software, processes, naming conventions and terminology set which we use inside our company to make static designs work in the browser.

Current design system has:
- **design tokens** - think of them as *designer variables* like: fonts, spacers, border sizes e.t.c; we take these tokens manually from figma and implement them in our app as CSS variables
- color synchronization via [[Chameleon]]

There are future plans for design system development, and they include auto synchronization from [[figma]] to [[React]] - but that's on the roadmap ðŸš§
