# Obsidian
To write articles I suggest using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

It is like an IDE for MarkDown - and it's pretty good at writing documentation

## How to start with obsidian
1. Download it
2. Just open this repo root folder as a **vault**
3. Configure a little bit
4. (optional) Install some plugins

That's all - just start writing 📝

## Configure obsidian
Right-click on `images` folder and set it as attachments folder

Now you can just `Ctrl+V` images and they will be inserted in images folder (just like the one above)

Learn/configure hotkeys. The main ones are (windows)
- `Ctrl + O` - open file / page
- `Ctrl + P` - all actions
- `Ctrl + Alt + right/left` - navigate forward / backward in history
- Type `[[` to add a wikilink - it's the killer feature of obsidian
- Press `Alt + Enter` to go inside article
- `Ctrl + N` - create new page; `F2` to rename it
- `Ctrl + Shift + F` - search in all files

I also like assigning these hotkeys (you can assign them in *Settings => Hotkeys*):
- `Ctrl + Alt + N` - Reveal active file in navigateion

## Install plugins
Go to *Settings => Community plugins => Browse* and install some plugins

### Emoji
Emojis are really helpful when writing articles to emphasise the idea
- Emoji shortcodes
- Emoji toolbar

![images/Pasted image 20221007114422.png](images/Pasted%20image%2020221007114422.png)

With emoji shortcodes you can start typing `:anything` and it will give you an emoji helper

![images/Pasted image 20221007115017.png](images/Pasted%20image%2020221007115017.png)

With emoji toolbar you can press `Ctrl + J` (assign hotkey to "Open Emoji Picker") and see a nice toolbar with emojis
