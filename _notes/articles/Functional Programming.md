# Functional thinking
short tutorial to what FP is, cons and pros

good examples how to rewrite class to function and how to curry function to make code easier

links to resources where to read about this

# Main concepts
explain immutability, pure functions, side effects, high-order functions (with damn good examples!)
# fp-ts
describe library, show practical examples and some complex functions

explain that with proper usage it reduces the amount of code operations to: `filter`, `map`, `group` and `sort` (and `reduce`)
