All our designs are in [[figma]]

Pixel perfect approach assumes that everything we see in figma is exactly the same in the browser, when implemented by developers - pixel to pixel (perfect).

# How to apply designs
explain how to work in figma, how to use it's grid to see pixels, how to apply spacing


# CSS variables
mention CSS vars as a way to build design system (example in DXChart project, TDW)

mention their performance (ask Alexey Korol about CSS vars performance - he has hands-on on this)


maybe explain what is atomic design - but make it adaptive
