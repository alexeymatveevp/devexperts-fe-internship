# Pure CSS and CSS modules

# Component Libraries
Bootstrap, Ant Design (ask Konstantin how it works out in Spectra), Material UI

explain how to apply them, what's the best fit for them (prototyping), are they production-ready or requires some tuning?

# CSS in JS
explain how this approach is different, pros and cons

## Styled Components
explain SC as our main CSS-in-JS framework

provide some basic usages and going to more complex examples

would be good to show the best practices that we discovered in Devex, the pitfalls
(mention className problem in React)

explain how to override styled (ask DXChart team - they have a lot of such experience, Denis Travin)

Also explain Linaria as a replacement which is faster (explain why), ask Pavel Udalov for help here - he has hands-on experience on replacing SC with Linaria

## Performance
explain how SC are compiled and how they actually work

provide some examples of SC compiled version, compare it with Linaria compiling approach
